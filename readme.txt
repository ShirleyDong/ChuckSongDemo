CS6117 Assignment 2Tianxia Dong  117220530In this assignment, I use chuck program to create an audio loop more than 5 minutes, here are some descriptions about my program.1.I use 6 unit generators for my program, 4 of them are used for generating melody and disposing sound, 2 of them are used for output of the melody in different instruments.2.I use arrays to generate my melody and use Midi-to-frequency function to translate them, I also use array to store the playback note for my melody.3.In this program I create a function for amplitude modulation and frequency modulation and use stroke to add and execute it.4.I loading three snare files and output it in a defined note array and do the frequency, spatial and amplitude manipulation for the sound.I also have a separate chuck file for my background music and use Machine.add function add it in my master sketch.5.I my program I use if statements to play the melody in different instruments and use for and while loop to play the note.6. There are three class and in my sketch. One class include the variables and the relationship for other two classes are extend. There is also an overloading between the functions in these classes.7.There are 4 sheds in my program.Learning Reasource:http://apprize.info/programming/chuck/http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/doc/
